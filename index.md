# What is this?

This is the best place to [learn](/learn/overview.html) about Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA).

- You can find [samples](/samples.html) of real apps that use VSA.
- You can find curated external [media](/media.html)

The site is primarily a knowledge base for VSA, but the code examples are for .NET/C#, typically thinking about a Web API on the ASP.NET Core engine. This is done using a companion [VSA Template]() that I maintain. The template, importantly, should *not* be the starting point. It is a tool to bootstrap the theory learnt here.

## An important note

This site is a new work in progress. If you have any feedback, please create a new [issue](https://github.com/Hona/VerticalSliceArchitecture.Documentation/issues) or [discussion](https://github.com/Hona/VerticalSliceArchitecture.Documentation/discussions).

> [!NOTE]
