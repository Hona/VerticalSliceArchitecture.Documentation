# ðŸ¤” What is this?

This is the source controlled static site for [verticalslicearchitecture.com](https://verticalslicearchitecture.com).

While it is early on in its development, it aims to be the go to place to learn about VSA concepts.

Additionally, it will demo how the theory can be applied via my [Vertical Slice Architecture Template](https://github.com/Hona/VerticalSliceArchitecture) as a companion to this site.
