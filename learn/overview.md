# Overview

There are 2 main areas of the learn section.

## Philosophy 
<!-- TODO: Think about this name. Does 'Philosophy' match the 'context'?. Maybe 'Cookbook' (rules? principles?) -->
This will cover:

- the history of VSA
- the guiding principles
- when to use it
- when NOT to use it
- what are the hard and fast rules of VSA
- the change of thinking (especially if you're coming from Clean Architecture)
- how your implementation might evolve over time
- how to act as a team

## Patterns

This is the more hands on side of the site. It goes over common patterns you might encounter while implementing VSA. It will also cover how to implement these patterns at a conceptual & practical level (using the [VSA Template](https://github.com/Hona/VerticalSliceArchitecture) using C# on .NET 8 & ASP.NET Core)
