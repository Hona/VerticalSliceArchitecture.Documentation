# ðŸ¤” What is this?

This is the source controlled static site for [verticalslicearchitecture.com](https://verticalslicearchitecture.com).

While it is early on in its development, it aims to be the go to place to learn about VSA concepts.

Additionally, it will demo how the theory can be applied via my [Vertical Slice Architecture Template](https://github.com/Hona/VerticalSliceArchitecture) as a companion to this site.

## Contributing

Contributions are absolutely welcome. Feel free to create an issue, discussion, or pull request.

## Working locally

The easiest way to get started is to run

```bash
docfx build --serve
```

However, when you're changing a lot, to see changes in realtime, its easier to use the hot reload script.

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D
```

Then run the hot reload (watch) script:

```bash
npm run watch
```
