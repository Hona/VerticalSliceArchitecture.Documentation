# Overview

There are 2 main areas of the learn section.

## Cookbook 

> The cookbook is for theory and higher level thinking. It's a comprehensive guide to VSA and how to think about it. It's a great place to start if you're new to VSA.

This will cover:

- the history of VSA
- the guiding principles
- when to use it
- when NOT to use it
- what are the hard and fast rules of VSA
- the change of thinking (especially if you're coming from Clean Architecture)
- how your implementation might evolve over time
- how to act as a team

## Recipes

> The recipes are strictly practical guides, that are hands on. Beyond trivial examples that exist online, more difficult questions are yet to be documented well. This is the place to go for those.

This is the more hands on side of the site. It goes over common patterns you might encounter while implementing VSA. It will also cover how to implement these patterns at a conceptual & practical level (using the [VSA Template](https://github.com/Hona/VerticalSliceArchitecture) using C# on .NET 8 & ASP.NET Core)
